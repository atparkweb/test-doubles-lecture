# TDD Examples (Mocks, Spies, Stubs, Fakes)

This project includes very basic and contrived examples of how to write different types of tests:
- Black Box: Only testing input and outputs
- White Box:
  - Checking if functions are called from other functions
  - Checking that conditional branches are checked

- Mock API request
- Mock a method
